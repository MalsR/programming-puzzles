###Find the Parity Outlier

Some of the example tests in codewars for this specific kata probably wasn't 
 accurate (for Java, although you were not able to see the whole test).

*Description:*

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. 
The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. 
Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns N.

For example:

[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]

Should return: 11

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]

Should return: 160
