###Description

An anagram is a word formed from another by rearranging its letters, using all the original letters exactly once;
for example, orchestra can be rearranged into carthorse.

Write a function that checks if two words are each other's anagrams, ignoring case.

For example, areAnagrams("momdad", "dadmom") should return true as arguments are anagrams.
