###Description

Write a function that checks if a given sentence is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, verse, or
sentence that reads the same backward or forward.

Only the order of English alphabet letters (A-Z and a-z) should be considered, other characters should be ignored.

For example, isPalindrome("Noel sees Leon.") should return true as spaces, period,
and case should be ignored resulting with "noelseesleon" which is a palindrome since it reads same backward and forward.
