###Description

Write a function that finds the zero-based index of the longest run in a string.
A run is a consecutive sequence of the same character.

If there is more than one run with the same length, return the index of the first one.

For example, indexOfLongestRun("abbcccddddcccbba") should return 6 as the longest run is dddd
and it first appears on index 6.
